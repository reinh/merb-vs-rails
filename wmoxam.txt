Rails

- has a large and active plugin development community which means that a lot of common, and many uncommon components 
  are easy to implement in a rails project

- due to it's age, and the number of people using it, it's easy to find documented solutions to nearly any sort of 
  development issue you may encounter on disucssion boards and in mailing list archives.

- one downside to the above is that there is a lot of *bad* rails documentation and advice online, much of it written 
  for older versions of Rails
