## Merb vs. Rails

Some general points: 

* speed/performance 
  - merb can handle more requests per second
  - doesn't block the same way as Rails so file uploads aren't so
  scary

* quality/style of code
  - merb has less magic. you can often open up a class and logically
  follow whats going on. 
  - extraneous/unnecessary code is found less in merb (the returning
  method is really only a convenience...you won't find it in merb)

* framework design/philosophy
  - more control...you can use just a little bit (--flat or
  --very-flat flags to generate small and one file projects
  respectively) or the whole stack if you prefer
  - framework split out into various gems to allow for above

* gems vs plugins
  - a matter of taste...but "plugin" type functionality isn't merb
  specific. it makes use of rubygems to bring in outside bundles of
  code

* running frozen merb/rails
  - easier to switch back and forth: you can run script/frozen-merb to
  use the frozen framework, or just merb to use the normally installed
  one, versus having rails installed in vendor/rails and always have
  that load. 

* overall feelings
  - merb feels more like a framework written by developers for
  developers. 
  - features like display @object, the router, etc all kind of give
  you the feeling that the overall design choices are made for
  specific, and good, reasons.
