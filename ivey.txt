* hackable
One of the things that is fundamentally different is the approach to opening it up.  Merb is designed for people who want to hack the framework.

* speed
If one release is slower than the previous one, it's a bug.

* smaller
"No code is faster than no code"

* lots of pieces
"All you need.  None you don't."

* flexible
Merb gives you options.  That's good and bad.  You're a grownup, you'll deal.
